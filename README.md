# Linux CUTEst Installer

This repository is solely for installing
CUTEst in an easy way including shared libraries.
My only objective is to give support to a simple installation for a
64 bits linux computer with gcc and gfortran.
If you are using OSX, I suggest the great
[homebrew-cutest](http://github.com/optimizers/homebrew-cutest).

This script uses the git versions of the CUTEst repository, namely
[cutest-mirror](http://github.com/optimizers/cutest-mirror),
[sifdecode-mirror](http://github.com/optimizers/sifdecode-mirror),
[archdefs-mirror](http://github.com/optimizers/archdefs-mirror),
[sifdecode-mirror](http://github.com/optimizers/sifdecode-mirror).

Also check the Julia interface for CUTEst,
[CUTEst.jl](http://github.com/JuliaOptimizers/CUTEst.jl).
